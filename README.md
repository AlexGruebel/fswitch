# fswitch (Fuzzy Switch)

fswitch is a lightweight Win32 application designed to let you fuzzy search and switch between open application windows. Simply type a quick query, and fswitch will identify the desired window and bring it into focus. The app closes automatically after successfully switching to the selected window.

Note: fswitch is only a side project created to explore and learn the basics of the Win32 API.
